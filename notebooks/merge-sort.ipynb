    "\n",
    "Here is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) $N$ is the length of the list,\n",
    "2) there are $O(log(N))$ calls till the empty list,\n",
    "3) splitting the list in 2 and joining it takes $O(N)$,\n",
    "4) so putting it all toguetter you have $log(N)$ calls of $O(N)$ complexity, with a resulting $O(Nlog(N))$ time complexity algorithm."
