    "## How the Actor Model Meets the Needs of Concurrent, Distributed Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrent computation model\n",
    "- Think of an actor as a fundamental unit of concurrent computation.\n",
    "- Like in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), actors hold state, but manage it through message passing rather than direct method calls.\n",
    "- Actors can modify their own private state but interact with each other only via messaging, which eliminates the need for lock-based synchronization.\n",
    "- Actors have a mailbox where messages arrive and are processed in the order they are received.\n",
    "- How an actor responds to a message essentially defines its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "An actor has the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Send messages to other actors,\n",
    "2) Respond to received messages, and\n",
    "3) Create new actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important difference of passing messages instead of calling methods is that messages have no return value. And\n",
    "Actors react to messages just like objects \"react\" to methods invoked on them. They execute independently from the senders of a message, and they react to incoming messages sequentially, at most one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://getakka.net/images/serialized_timeline_invariants.png\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to an organizational hierarchy, actors in Akka naturally form tiers.\n",
    "  - For example, an actor responsible for a particular function within the program may choose to break down its task into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
    "  - To achieve this, it creates child actors, over which it maintains supervisory control.\n",
    "* Each actor has one supervisor, the actor that initiated its creation.\n",
    "* When an actor is unable to address a certain situation, it sends a failure message to its supervisor, requesting assistance.\n",
    "* This recursive setup enables failure handling at the appropriate level in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://getakka.net/images/actor_tree_supervision.png\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messages and Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages can be any kind of object but have to be immutable. Messages are sent to an Actor using one of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **tell (!)** : a \"fire-and-forget\" approach, where a message is sent asynchronously, and the sender returns immediately without waiting for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ask (?)** : sends a message asynchronously but returns a `Future` that represents a possible reply from the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In each of these methods, the sender has the option to include its own `ActorRef`.\n",
    "This allows the receiving actor to respond directly to the sender, as the reference to the sender is passed along with the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Message ordering is guaranteed for messages sent from the same sender to a receiver."
