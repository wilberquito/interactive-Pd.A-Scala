    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a brief tour, not a full language tutorial. If\n",
    "you want that, consider obtaining [a book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/books.html) or consulting\n",
    "[other resources](https://docs.scala-lang.org/learn.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Scala?\n",
    "Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scala is object-oriented ##\n",
    "Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that [every value is an object](unified-types.ipynb). Types and behavior of objects are described by [classes](classes.ipynb) and [traits](traits.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scala is functional ##\n",
    "Scala is also a functional language in the sense that [every function is a value](unified-types.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Scala provides a [lightweight syntax](basics.ipynb#functions) for defining anonymous functions,\n",
    "- it supports [higher-order functions](higher-order-functions.ipynb),\n",
    "- it allows functions to be [nested](nested-functions.ipynb),\n",
    "- and supports [currying](multiple-parameter-lists.ipynb).\n",
    "- [Case classes](case-classes.ipynb) and [pattern matching](pattern-matching.ipynb) will allow us to work with algebraic types in a clean way.\n",
    "- A convenient way to group functions, other objects and classes that aren't members of a class is provided by [singleton objects](singleton-objects.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scala's type system\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala is statically typed, **every type's expression in Scala is known at compile time**.\n",
    "The language is equipped with an expressive type system that enforces statically that abstractions are used in a safe and coherent manner. \n",
    "In particular, the type system supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [generic classes](generic-classes.ipynb)\n",
    "* [variance annotations](variances.ipynb)\n",
    "* [upper](upper-type-bounds.ipynb) and [lower](lower-type-bounds.ipynb) type bounds,\n",
    "* [inner classes](inner-classes.ipynb) and [abstract types](abstract-types.ipynb) as object members\n",
    "* [compound types](compound-types.ipynb)\n",
    "* [explicitly typed self references](self-types.ipynb)\n",
    "* [implicit parameters](implicit-parameters.ipynb) and [conversions](implicit-conversions.ipynb)\n",
    "* [polymorphic methods](polymorphic-methods.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala also privides [type inference](type-inference.ipynb), meaning that **it is not required to annotate code with type information**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In combination, these features provide a powerful basis for the safe reuse of programming abstractions and for the type-safe extension of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scala interoperates\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala is designed to interoperate well with the popular Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In particular;\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interaction with the mainstream object-oriented Java programming language is smooth.\n",
    "- Newer Java features like SAMs, [lambdas](higher-order-functions.ipynb), [annotations](annotations.ipynb), and [generics](generic-classes.ipynb) have direct analogues in Scala.\n",
    "- Scala features without Java analogues, such as [default](default-parameter-values.ipynb) and [named parameters](named-arguments.ipynb), compile as close to Java as they can reasonably come.\n",
    "- Scala has the same compilation model (separate compilation, dynamic class loading) like Java and allows access to thousands of existing high-quality libraries."
